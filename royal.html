                            Royal Enfield Super Meteor 650 Summary<br>
                            Royal Enfield Super Meteor 650 is a cruiser bike available <br>in 3 variants and 7 colours. Super Meteor 650 price<br> starts at Rs. 3,54,398 in India with<br> top variant price starting from Rs. 3,84,845. <br>The Royal Enfield Super Meteor 650 is powered by 648cc BS6 engine which develops a power of 46.3 bhp and a torque of 52.3 Nm. With both front and rear disc brakes, Royal Enfield Super Meteor 650 comes up with anti-locking braking system. This Super Meteor 650 bike weighs 241 kg and has a fuel tank capacity of 15.7 liters.
                            
                            Royal Enfield has launched the new Super Meteor 650 in the Indian market and this motorcycle is available in two variants – standard and Tourer.
                            
                            In terms of styling, the new Royal Enfield Super Meteor 650 carries a cruiser motorcycle design. The styling cues on both variants of this new Royal Enfield motorcycle include a round headlight at the front, an aluminium finish on the switchgear, a curvy fuel tank with 3D logos, a split-style seat, and twin-sided exhaust pipes. The Tourer version further benefits from touring-focused hardware such as a tall windscreen for better windblast protection and a pillion backrest for enhanced comfort. Royal Enfield will also offer a wide range of accessories to further customise these motorcycles.
                            
                            The standard version is available in five colour options – Astral Black, Astral Blue, Astral Green, Interstellar Grey, and Interstellar Green. Meanwhile, the Super Meteor 650 Tourer, has been listed in two paint options – Celestial Red and Celestial Blue.
                            
                            The differences between the two variants are limited to styling cues. Meanwhile, the mechanical specifications on both variants include the same 648cc, parallel-twin, air-cooled motor that also powers the Interceptor 650 and Continental GT 650. Linked to a six-speed gearbox, this motor is tuned to produce 46.2bhp and 52Nm of peak torque on the Super Meteor 650. Royal Enfield says that the Super Meteor 650 gets a different engine map and gear ratios as compared to the Interceptor 650 and the Continental GT 650. The Super Meteor 650 tips the weighing scale at 241kg, making it substantially heavier than the existing 650cc Royal Enfield motorcycles.
                            
                            Standard features on both variants include an LED headlight and a semi-digital instrument cluster with Royal Enfield’s Tripper Navigation system that works with Google Maps and shows turn-by-turn directions. Then, the electronic aids comprise dual-channel ABS.
                            
                            Notably, the new Super Meteor 650 rides on alloy wheels instead of wire-spoke units on the Interceptor 650 and the Continental GT 650. Thus, this cruiser motorcycle comes with tubeless tyres. The suspension tasks are handled by upside-down front forks and twin-sided rear springs. Further, the braking setup comprises single discs on both wheels along with ByBre-sourced calipers.
                            
                            The Super Meteor 650 has been priced competitively and the only rivals to this Royal Enfield compete in a much higher price range. These include the Kawasaki Vulcan S and the Benelli 502C.

                            Royal Enfield Super Meteor 650 Review
                            Good Things
                            649cc parallel-twin engine offers good performance
                            Overall fit and finish are good
                            Good seating comfort
                            Could be Better
                            Heavy kerb weight
                            Stiff ride quality
                            BikeWale's Take
                            The Super Meteor 650 is a proper cruiser that gets great aspirational styling, good comfort level and an engine that churns out great performance. It is loaded with some modern features too. In fact, this bike gets an LED headlight. However, due to its cruiser nature, the bike is on the heavier side and also gets a stiff ride quality.

                            As for the hardware, the Royal Enfield Himalayan comes equipped with 21-inch front and 17-inch rear wire-spoke wheels. These come shod with dual-sport rubber from Ceat. Then, the suspension duties are handled by 41mm telescopic forks at the front and a link-type monoshock at the back.

                            As far as competition is concerned, the Royal Enfield Himalayan rivals the KTM 390 Adventure, BMW G310 GS, Suzuki V-Strom SX, and the KTM 250 Adventure in India.
