                            <p>
                                Kawasaki Vulcan S is a cruiser bike available in only 1 variant and 1 colour. Vulcan S price starts at Rs. 7,10,000 in India. The Kawasaki Vulcan S is powered by 649cc BS6 engine which develops a power of 59.94 bhp and a torque of 62.4 Nm. With both front and rear disc brakes, Kawasaki Vulcan S comes up with anti-locking braking system. This Vulcan S bike weighs 235 kg and has a fuel tank capacity of 14 liters.

                                Kawasaki India has announced the launch of the 2023 Vulcan S in our market. For 2023, this Royal Enfield Super Meteor 650 rival from the Japanese manufacturer is available in a single variant and one paint option – Metallic Matte Carbon Grey.

                                The changes to the 2023 model are limited to the addition of the new paint theme. Meanwhile, the styling remains unaltered, and the 2023 Kawasaki Vulcan S retains the long and low stance, single-pod headlight, curvy design for the fuel tank, rider-only saddle, and compact exhaust. Similarly, the mechanical specifications remain unchanged as well, and the 2023 Kawasaki Vulcan S continues to use the 649cc, parallel-twin, liquid-cooled engine. Linked to a six-speed gearbox, this motor is tuned to deliver a maximum output of 59.9bhp at 7,500rpm and a peak torque of 62.4Nm at 6,600rpm.

                                The hardware on the 2023 model, similar to the previous version, includes a perimeter frame, 41mm telescopic front forks, and a preload-adjustable rear monoshock. The braking duties are handled by a 300mm single disc at the front and a 250mm single rotor at the back, while the safety net includes a dual-channel ABS. Other key dimensions of the 2023 Kawasaki Vulcan S include a 14-litre fuel tank, 235kg of kerb weight, 705mm of seat height, and 130mm of ground clearance.

                                Apart from the Royal Enfield Super Meteor 650, the Kawasaki Vulcan S also faces competition from the Benelli 502C in the Indian market. Notably, both the cruiser-style motorcycles from Royal Enfield and Benelli retail in a much lower price range than the Kawasaki Vulcan S.

                                Kawasaki Ninja H2R is a super bike available in only 1 variant and 1 colour. Ninja H2R price starts at Rs. 79,90,000 in India. The Kawasaki Ninja H2R is powered by 998cc BS6 engine which develops a power of 305.75 bhp and a torque of 165 Nm. With both front and rear disc brakes, Kawasaki Ninja H2R comes up with anti-locking braking system. This Ninja H2R bike weighs 216 kg and has a fuel tank capacity of 17 liters.

                            Kawasaki India has updated its product portfolio with the launch of the 2021 Ninja H2R. The latest iteration of the track-only motorcycle is available at Rs 79.90 lakh as against Rs 75.80 lakh previously, a premium of Rs 4.10 lakh over its predecessor.

                            The 2021 Ninja H2R retains the styling of its predecessor. The 2021 model continues to use aerodynamic winglets on the fairing and on the windscreen, a rider-only saddle, a trellis frame, and a single-sided swingarm. The single-sided swingarm design allows the company to install the exhaust silencer closer to the motorcycle’s centreline. Being a track-only motorcycle, the Ninja H2R misses features such as a headlamp, rear-view mirrors, and turn indicators. The motorcycle tips the weighing scale at 216kg (kerb).

                            The 2021 Ninja H2R is available in a single paint option – Mirror Coated Matte Spark Black. Kawasaki has installed a special coat to the paint that allows minor scratches to repair themselves.

                            The motorcycle continues to use the supercharged, 998cc, inline-four, liquid-cooled engine that requires a minimum octane rating of RON95. Linked to a six-speed gearbox, the motor produces 305.7bhp (321.8bhp with RAM Air) of maximum power at 14,000rpm and 165Nm of peak torque at 12,500rpm. The transmission benefits from a slipper/assist clutch and a bidirectional quickshifter.

                            The feature list on the motorcycle comprises a Bosch-sourced Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) that works with Kawasaki Cornering Management Function. The instrument cluster displays the bank angle and maximum bank angle achieved. The electronic rider aids include cornering ABS, traction control, wheelie control, slide control, launch control, and engine brake control.

                            The hardware on the 2021 Ninja H2R includes 43mm upside-down front forks and an Ohlins TTX36 gas-charged rear mono-shock – both fully adjustable – to perform the suspension tasks. An Ohlins electronic steering damper is also part of the package. The braking setup includes twin 330mm discs with four-piston Brembo M50 Monobloc callipers at the front and a single 250mm rotor with two-piston Brembo calliper at the back.
